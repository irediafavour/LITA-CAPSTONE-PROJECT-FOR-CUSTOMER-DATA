### Project Overview
This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of customer subscription data, sourced from multiple markets and stores within Nigeria's four main regions. By leveraging Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Pivot Tables, I aimed to uncover valuable insights into subscription trends and patterns. The findings were presented in an interactive Power BI dashboard, providing a user-friendly interface for decision-makers to explore the data and make informed strategic choices.

### Data Source
The data for this analysis was sourced from various point-of-sale (POS) systems across the four geopolitical regions in Nigeria: North, East and West. These POS systems track and record customer subscription data, which provides detailed information such as:
* Customer Name: The name of the individual that subscribed
* Subscription Type: The different types of subscription plan
* Subscription start date: The date that the subscription became activated 
* Subscription end date: The date that the subscription became terminated
* Region: The geographical areas (north, south, east and west) where the different stores operate
* Revenue: The money paid for any subscription type

### Project Objectives
This project aims to understand customer behaviour, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. 

### Formula Used
1. Average Subscription Type = Datedif(subscription start - subscription end)

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: For analysing the data
- Pivot Table: To organise, summarize and filter the data for easy interpretation
- Structured Query Language: For manipulating 
- Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards

## DATA ANALYSIS
This analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel's PivotTable feature to efficiently summarize and analyze the data. By leveraging PivotTables, I was able to uncover different subscription patterns within the dataset. 
 ### Total count of each subscription type
